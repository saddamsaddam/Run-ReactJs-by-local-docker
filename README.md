### ✅ **Step 1: Install Docker (with Buildx and Docker Compose)**
Now let's install Docker and the necessary components, including Buildx and Docker Compose.

#### Add Docker's official repository:
```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc > /dev/null
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

#### Install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

This will install Docker along with the necessary components.

### ✅ **Step 2: Verify Docker and Buildx Installation**
Now that Docker is installed, check if Buildx is available:
```bash
docker buildx version
```

If this works, then **Docker and Buildx** are installed successfully.

### ✅ **Step 3: Restart Docker**
In case Docker isn't running, restart it:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```




### Run react project by docker:

1. **Create nginx.conf in react root project directory:**:

   In your React project directory, run the following command to build your app:
   ```bash
      server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name localhost;
    
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    
        location / {
            try_files $uri /index.html;
        }
    
        error_page 404 /index.html;
    
        location = /50x.html {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }
      }

   ```

  

2. **Rebuild your React app**:

   In your React project directory, run the following command to build your app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build/` directory containing the production-ready version of your app.

3. **create Dockerfile**:

   Ensure your `Dockerfile` copies the `build/` directory into the correct location inside the container. Here's an example of what your Dockerfile might look like:

   ```Dockerfile
    # Use the official Node.js image as the base image
    FROM node:22 AS build
    
    WORKDIR /app
    
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    # Fix permission issues with node binaries
    RUN chmod -R 755 node_modules/.bin

    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Use the official Nginx image
    FROM nginx:alpine
    
    # Copy the updated nginx.conf
    COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    
    # Copy the build output to Nginx html directory
    COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
    
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


   ```

   This Dockerfile does the following:
   - It first builds the React app using a Node.js image (`node:16`).
   - Then, it uses an Nginx image (`nginx:alpine`) to serve the built React app.
   - It copies the contents of the `build/` directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the Nginx container.

4.### ✅ **Move project directory in Ubuntu cmd:**

```bash
 cd /mnt/c/reactjs/myreactapp/ReactJsProject
```

5. **Rebuild the Docker image**:

   After updating the Dockerfile, rebuild the Docker image by running the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-react-app .
   ```

6. **Run the Docker container again**:

   Once the image is rebuilt, run the container again:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:80 my-react-app // docker run -d -p 3000:80 my-react-app

   ```

7. **Access your app**:

   Finally, open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Your React app should now be properly served by Nginx and accessible.
